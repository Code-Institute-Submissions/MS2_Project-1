# Simon Squares

Simon Squares is a memory testing game where the user attempts to recreate the pattern sequence that the cpu displays prior to the users' guess.
The inspiration was taken from the 'Simon' electronic game from the 1980's and also from this [website...](https://www.memozor.com/simon-games/simon-game-colored-squares)

# UX

### Strategy
The design strategy for this project was simple...

* Create a simple memory game that tests the users' ability to remember a certain sequence of randomly appearing coloured squares in a predefined grid of squares.

* The User Interface would consist of a grid of 16 squares in a 4x4 grid arrangement.

### Scope
Things to include in this game is obviously the playing arena which would be the grid spoken of earlier. I would need (as a user) to see something that indicates which level I am on at any given moment and maybe a life counter.

The name of the player will need to be displayed also and this would be inputted by the user before the game is played.

There must be a section where the user can read the instructions on how to play the game - a demo maybe?

If the user reaches the end of the game (which could be trying to remember a sequence of 20 coloured grid squares) then he/she could have their name recorded on a 'high-score table' with the possibility of being interactive by clicking on other high score holders and seeing their location on a google map.


### Structure

The basic structure of this project could be divided up into 3 or 4 pages.

* A welcome title page with links to play the game, instructions and to view the highscore table

* The main game page showing the title of the game, the players name, level and lives remaining.

* A page showing the instructions on how to play.

* A page showing the previous players' high scores so far.

### Skeleton
[Here](https://github.com/GOSUB-C64/MS2_Project/tree/master/assets/wireframes/MS2_Wireframe.pdf) I have attempted to get a look and feel for the page layout of the game using wireframes.
