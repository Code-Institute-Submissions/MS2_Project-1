# Browser Tests

## Google Chrome

* This memory game project was developed on the Google Chrome Browser using the supplied dev tools.

* It is responsive on all major screen sizes with no glitches or obvious kinks in the layout.

## Firefox

* Everything looks good

* one thing to point out is that on the modals it now says 'Submit Query' but I think thats down to the browser itself and how it handles that.

## Opera 

* On each page there was a bit of vertical scrolling to be seen but I that is because of the default browser URI bar at top of screen. When fullscreen was toggled it seemed to stop this vertical scrolling on all 4 pages.

* A white bar at the left, right and bottom of the page was seen in the instructions page when you click 'How to Play' from the index page.

## Internet Explorer

* index.html - loaded good - nothing obvious out of place.

* instructions.html - loaded ok but 'wobbles' when scroll attempts are made.

* high-scores.html - problem showing Name data and Level data - must be with the txt file where this data is stored.
Back button also not working.

* main.html - modal for alerting user didnt appear on request. Grid layout is all wrong. Players name, Level and Lives data nit showing.



## Microsoft Edge

* index.html - page loaded great - all good.

* instructions.html - page loaded - all good.

* high-scores.html - problem loading in data from txt file.

* main.html - problems with showing the Players name, Level amount and Lives.
